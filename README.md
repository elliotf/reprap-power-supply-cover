# reprap-power-supply-cover

A cover for a 12V power supply, because mains voltage out in the open can make for a bad day.

# Notes

This was one of my first designs, and it shows.  It's a relatively tough print, with a lot of overhangs and has issues with the thin posts getting good adhesion with one another.  However, even "bad" prints of this can do the intended job.

Also, there is a lot of redundancy in the difference supply covers.  I really ought to unify the redundant parts.
